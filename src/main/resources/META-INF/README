To override the stock vert.x Pump:

 1. Add a META-INF/services descriptor resource file for the PumpFactory pointing to a custom factory;
 2. Provide the custom factory implementation.

 This implementation provides a custom PumpImpl class (almost completely identical to the standard one) with
 just an extra method:

 - long getBytesPumped();

which returns the total number of bytes transferred by the pump so far.
