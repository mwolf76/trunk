I started this project in 2017 to have something to experiment with while learning to develop web applications
with the Vert.X toolkit (http://vertx.io/). It is intended to act as a Dropbox-like file storage application. It
uses OAuth2 as an authorization mechanism. Keycloak (for local development) and Google (for production)
are currently supported.
